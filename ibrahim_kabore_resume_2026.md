EXPERIENCE
Data Science Intern (Soil Spectroscopy & ML Modeling)Feb. 2025 – Jul. 2025
UM6P - Center for Remote Sensing Applications (CRSA) Ben Guerir , Morocco
–Engineered automated pipelines for soil spectral data (Vis-NIR), utilizing SNV/MSC and PCA for standardization.
–Trained Random Forest and SVR models to predict Soil Organic Matter with high precision tailored for Moroccan
soil.
–Established the ”Trust & Quality” framework to calculate model uncertainty (Confidence Intervals).
–Harmonized multi-source soil libraries across Mediterranean datasets, ensuring QA/QC for large-scale integration.
Remote Sensing Researcher (Radar-Based Monitoring)Feb. 2024 – Jul. 2025
Research Project (Sidi Bennour Region) Morocco
–Built cloud-based monitoring workflows usingGoogle Earth Engine (GEE)to process multi-temporal Sentinel-1
(SAR).
–Integrated climate data (CHIRPS Rainfall, ERA5) with vegetation indices to model crop response to thermal stress.
–Conducted time-series analysis to differentiate resilience patterns between irrigated and rainfed systems.
PROJECTS
Agentic AI Chatbot for Agriculture|Python, RAG, QLoRA, CrewAI2025
